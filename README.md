# Pose-Detection-using-MediaPipe
This repository contains a Python script for pose detection using the MediaPipe library. Pose detection involves identifying key points on a person's body, such as the nose, shoulders, elbows, and knees. The script processes static images and provides real-time pose detection through a webcam.
